# SPSCrawlBCS

The files of this project are the companion assets for the blog post series starting at
http://chad-hinton.blogspot.com/2015/06/whats-up.html.

This series of posts walks through creating a BCS model to be crawled by SharePoint 
Search and supports a segmented crawl that enables use cases of millions of rows without
having to write .net assemblies.
